#EXAM RANK 05

### 42 Cursus - 4th Exam

##### In this exam we must demostrate our hability in C++. This is the 4th exam during the cursus, and the first one in C++. In this exam we must complete three different exercises in less than three hours.

##### If your are doing 42 Cursus, you must know that your time is limited, so if you are not very good typing you must reuse your own code. I create a [table in Excel](Tabla_Modificaciones.xlsx) with the exercises, files and all the changes that you must do in each file to recycle it from previus exercises to the new ones. I hope that it help you to get success in this exam. 

##### Practice "copy, paste and delete line" in VIM, also "cp" and "mv" commands, both skills will be very helpfull to complete it on time.
